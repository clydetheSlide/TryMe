# TryMe
I am just learning.<br>
<p>If I add another line, like this and want it to be in a new branch,<br>
do I just poke the Branch  button in the git interface? I named it branch1.
<p>That seemed to work on the local environment.<br>
VSCODE offered the option to "Publish new branch?" And now there are two branches on github.
